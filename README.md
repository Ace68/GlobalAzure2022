# Introduction 
With Minimal API we haven't a project template to follow to build our API. 
Is this a problem, or an opportunity?

Using MVC pattern to build our API is a very good solution, but sometimes it's a bit over.

DDD offers several patterns that allow us to design our APIs more domain-oriented than structure-oriented.
